# Web-Scraped-Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations
From the website of my choice, setup a web scraping pipeline to scrape data from at least five pages. Place the data in a pandas DataFrame, clean the data, if necessary, and then perform data analysis that answers a minimum of four questions about the data.

Contents of my project:
* The code that scrapes the websites.

Websites:
* Main: https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/
